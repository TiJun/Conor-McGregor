                    fighter of mixed martial arts and was born on July 14, 1988, in Dublin, Ireland. Conor McGregor is
                    known for competing and excelling in categories such as lightweight and featherweight, also for
                    being the first and only fighter to win two titles in two different divisions at the same time.</p>

                        would take place on 12
                        December, and McGregor would face Jos√© Aldo for the UFC Featherweight Championship. At the
                        weigh-ins, both McGregor and Aldo achieved the weight limit of 145 pounds. McGregor
                        knocked
                        out Aldo thirteen seconds into the first round with a left hook, snapping his seven-year-long

                        of
                        the Night" bonus as well. This finish marked the fastest knockout in a title bout in UFC
                        history.</p>

                    <p class="doublechamp__text doublechamp__text--second">On 27 September, it was officially announced
                        that McGregor's next
                        bout would be against Eddie Alvarez for the UFC Lightweight Championship on 12 November at UFC
                        205. After dropping Alvarez multiple times throughout the first round, McGregor landed a
                        multiple-punch combination to stop his opponent via technical knockout in the second round.
                        This
                        result marked the first time a competitor had held UFC championships in two different weight
                        classes, and also repeated McGregor's feat during his career at Cage Warriors. This win
                        earned him the "Performance of the Night", and it is widely considered one of McGregor's best
                        performances inside the octagon.</p>
